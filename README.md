# PSKoans Practice ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This repo tracks my progress solving [PSKoans](https://github.com/vexx32/PSKoans), an interactive way to learn and master PowerShell through real scripting challenges.

## Current Topics

- Arrays
- Strings
- Script blocks
- Conditionals
- Functions

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

- Build deeper understanding of PowerShell logic and syntax
- Sharpen my skills for real-world automation tasks in IAM and security
- Document learning and help others follow the same path

Let's automate everything, one `koan` at a time.
